									<h2>Unit 1 - 3</h2>
									<p class="regular-text">The first collaborative discussion considered the impact an outage of an information system has, taking economic costs, reputational costs and the implication it has on customers into consideration.
										During my own research as well as while I read the work of my fellow students, I gained additional insights into the risks associated to the interconnectivity of devices. This raised ethical concerns and let me think about how to mitigate these issues. While I was able to come up with several own thoughts on the topic, especially the reading of the contributions of others managed to deepen my considerations on the topic as others approached the task slightly different than I did.

									<h2>Unit 2</h2>
									<p class="regular-text">As preparation for the unit 2 seminar, I conducted an EDA tutorial. Here, I was first guided through the whole EDA process and then, in a second step, conducted an EDA on my own, following a defined approach. While I was already used to the EDA process, it helped refresh my knowledge and get even more comfortable with this approach.

										<h2>Unit 3</h2>
										<p class="regular-text">In this unit, I worked through several Jupyter Notebooks considering the topics correlation and regression, this way getting an even better understanding of the theory behind both which was taught in the lecture cast and the reading. I also played around with some of the variables in the Jupyter Notebooks which enabled me to see the effects of this on the outcomes. These tasks enabled me to put the theoretic knowledge I already had and expanded during the unit to practice using Python.</p>

										<h2>Unit 4</h2>
										<p class="regular-text">In the preparation for this unitâ€™s seminar, I conducted multiple linear regressions on my own. This further helped apply my theoretical knowledge in praxis using Python. Furthermore, a process I was not familiar with before is the process of estimating a linear regression for categorical values. This is a task that I learned new within these exercises. I immediately saw how useful this additional method is as I used it to estimate regression coefficients for the influence that specific regions within New York have on the pricing, answering an important part of the business question we chose in the unit 6 group assignment.</p>

										<h2>Unit 5</h2>
										<p class="regular-text">In unit 5, the unsupervised learning technique clustering was introduced, especially the K Means Clustering method. Adding on the background supplied by the lecture cast and the readings, in a wiki exercise I plotted the algorithmic logic behind the K Means Clustering method. This enabled me to get an even deeper understanding how the algorithm behind K Means Clustering works, also enabling me to spot important limitations of using this algorithm.
											In an additional exercise, I calculated Jaccard Coefficients for different pairs of individuals given their pathological test results. This task enabled me to see how the Jaccard Coefficient differs given different levels of similarity of the data for two individuals, once again putting the learned theory to use in a practical use case.

										<h2>Unit 6</h2>
										<p class="regular-text">In this unit, the first graded assignment was due. Together with my team I submitted a report on how different factors influence the price of an Airbnb listing in New York. The final submissions can be accessed. Over the weeks, we collaborated as a team towards this final submission. We split up tasks, agreed on deadlines and were able to incorporate both interests and skills of each team member into our project planning. All this is documented in our project documentation. As I handled the geographical analysis, i.e., how the different locations within New York influence the price, I put together an interesting visualisation of prices pinned by location using Geopandas which is an important part of our final report.
											For the unit 6 seminar, I solved different K Means Clustering tasks. Once again, this task allowed me to use the theoretical knowledge I already had and extended during the unit in practice. Furthermore, it also again showed some of the limitations the K Means Clustering method has, e.g., the difficulty to choose the correct number of classes to classify for.

										<h2>Unit 7</h2>
										<p class="regular-text">Unit 7 introduced the concept of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These mimic the biology of the human brain to solve more complex tasks. In an exercise, I worked through several different Jupyter Notebooks presenting different ANNs. I once again made changes to some of the parameters to analyse how this changes the outputs. This again gave me a better understanding of the theoretical concepts behind ANNs introduced in the lecture cast and in the readings. As this concept is completely new to me, I needed to put some more effort into understanding it than for the concepts before.

										<h2>Unit 8</h2>
										<p class="regular-text">Here, on one hand, a more detailed overview into the training of artificial neural networks, i.e. via the process of backpropagation, was given. In an exercise I worked through a Jupyter Notebook, aiming at understanding the interplay of learning rate and number of iterations for a gradient descend cost function. This helped me get an even deeper understanding in the inner workings of artificial neural networks and how several parameters must be kept in mind when ensuring high performance at minimal costs.
											On the other hand, this unit the second collaborative discussion started. It circled around ethical implication of the usage of AI, i.e. large language models, for writing. The examination of this topic helped me get a better understanding of several ethical perspectives on this topic, considering both benefits and concerns.

										<h2>Unit 9</h2>
										<p class="regular-text">Now, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were introduced, neural networks that are especially helpful when classifying images or detecting objects in images. In an exercise I worked through a Jupyter Notebook. Here, a CNN was coded step by step, enabling a better understanding of its components and how they are coded. By switching the input image and comparing the results, I saw how the modelâ€™s output looks like. 
											Furthermore, this unit entailed the peer responses for the collaborative discussion that started in unit 8. By examining the works of other students, I learned about some additional benefits and challenges of the usage of GenAI in writings which others came up with and I did not think about before.

										<h2>Unit 10</h2>
										<p class="regular-text">This unit delivered some more depth to my understanding of CNNs. In an interactive visualisation of the CNN layers and how they interplay, I learned more about how a CNN comes up with a classification. Testing the given CNN with own images either belonging to the classes the model was trained on or not, I also received additional insights on how the model derives classes based on proximity to the training images. 
											Furthermore, in this unit I finalised the second collaborative discussion with a summary post. Summing up my own thoughts as well as the responses by my peers again enabled me to reflect on the general topic of using LLM for writings and deepened my thoughts on this topic additionally.

										<h2>Unit 11</h2>
										<p class="regular-text">This unit focuses on the evaluation of neural networks and the resulting choice for the most performant model. In an e-portfolio activity, I worked through different options of measuring the performance for different machine learning algorithms, i.e., regressions and classifications. I analysed the effect that adjustments of different parameters had on the evaluating metrics.
											In the second graded assignment I created a 20 minute presentation about the training and evaluation of a Convolutional Neural Network for the classification of the CIFAR-10 dataset. The assignment consisted of the video of the presentation, the transcript, the slides and the Jupyter Notebook that contains the underlying code. Putting together an own neural network with all necessary steps really improved my understanding of the underlying concepts and my confidence in applying them. I learned to outweigh different concepts and choose the best fit for a given use case.

										<h2>Unit 12</h2>
										<p class="regular-text">This unit focused on the future of machine learning. In the seminar preparation, I read an academic article and based on this discussed the use case for predictive prognostic machine learning models in chemical manufacturing and its emergence due to Industry 4.0 and the interconnectivity of smart devices via sensors. This final task gave some examples of how machine learning models can be used in a professional work environment and benefits as well as limitations were worked out in a critical discussion. This motivates the further development of ideas on how to use machine learning in my own daily work and in my company`s industry.</p>
